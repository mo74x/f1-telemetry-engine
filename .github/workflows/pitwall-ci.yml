# Trigger: Run on every push to 'main' or when a Pull Request is opened
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x] # Test on Node 18 and 20 to ensure compatibility

    steps:
    # 1. Check out your code from the repo
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Setup Node.js environment
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm' # This speeds up the next step significantly!

    # 3. Install Dependencies (Clean Install)
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci 
      # 'npm ci' is strictly for CI/CD. It follows package-lock.json exactly.

    # 4. Linting (Code Style Check)
    - name: Lint Code
      run: npm run lint
      # Fails if you left unused variables or messy formatting.

    # 5. Build (TypeScript Compiler Check)
    - name: Build Application
      run: npm run build
      # Fails if there are TypeScript errors (e.g., passing string to number function).

    # 6. Run Unit Tests
    - name: Run Unit Tests
      run: npm run test
      # Fails if any logic is broken.
